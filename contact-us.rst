Need to get in touch? Want to request some help? Report a problem? Maybe just say hello? Here are your options:

- you can **email the admins** at help@cropdiversity.ac.uk
- or get in touch **via Slack** using https://cropdiversity-hpc.slack.com

Email is best if you need a response from a system administrator, whereas Slack is ideal for more general, community-based support where you can discuss HPC, Linux, bioinformatics, the weather...

The admins

Iain has been nuts on computers ever since getting access to a BBC Micro in the early 80s. His enthusiasm for them hasn't waned over time, and he now splits his time between all things HPC/Linux and more general software development, concentrating on infomatics visualization and decision support tools.
