Crop Diversity HPC Help
=======================

Hello! Here you'll find the documentation for the UK's `Crop Diversity Bioinformatics High Performance Computing (HPC) <https://www.cropdiversity.ac.uk>`_ Linux cluster - ``gruffalo`` - and its associated data storage and services.

.. important::
  Run by the James Hutton Institute's `Information & Computational Sciences <https://ics.hutton.ac.uk>`_ (ICS) Research Computing team, and the Scientific Computing section of NIAB's IT team, this resource supports the computational needs of researchers from **six UK institutions**. See :doc:`organizations` for details.

.. note::
  Compute clusters contain a lot of CPUs, so it's worth seeing how we're :doc:`cpus`.
